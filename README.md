## 🚀 Project Structure

You'll see the following folders and files:

```text
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── content/
│   ├── i18n/
│   │   ├── i18n.ts ← Set up locales here
│   │   ├── uiStrings.js ← Localized headings, labels, etc.
│   │   └── utilities ← i18n-specific functions
│   ├── layouts/
│   ├── libs/
│   ├── styles/
│   ├── utilities/
│   ├── consts.ts ← Settings loaded by astro.config.mjs
│   ├── env.d.ts
│   └── header.ts ← Settings for header menus, optionally per locale
├── astro.config.mjs
├── README.md
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

The `src/content/` directory contains collections of related markdown and MDX documents. A 'blog' collection has been defined already.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All default commands can be run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                    | Action                                           |
